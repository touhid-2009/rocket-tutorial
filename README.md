# Rocket: Advanced Secure Tunneling Project 🚀

## 📋 Introduction

**Rocket** is an advanced project designed to create secure and fast tunnels that support various network protocols. Built with Go, it offers unique capabilities for data transmission, ensuring both efficiency and security.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🌐 Supported Protocols
- **TCPMUX**: A flexible protocol for multiplexing TCP connections.
- **WSMUX**: Optimized for WebSocket multiplexing.

### 🚀 High Performance
- **Optimized Memory Management**: Utilizes buffer pools for efficient memory use.
- **Concurrent Connection Handling**: Supports thousands of simultaneous connections.
- **Data Compression**: Implements LZ4 for fast data compression.
- **Encryption**: Uses XOR encryption for secure data transmission.

### 🔒 Security and Stability
- **Token-Based Authentication**: Ensures high security for user sessions.
- **Stable Connections**: Features keep-alive and retry mechanisms for reliable connectivity.
- **Error Management**: Automatic detection and recovery from errors.

## 🎯 Applications

### **Network Tunneling**
- Secure data transmission over the internet.
- Bypass network restrictions.
- Create a personal VPN.

### **Proxy and Load Balancer**
- Distribute load among servers.
- Reverse proxy capabilities.
- Connection management for better resource utilization.
